This is the nflistdata package for PARI/GP, to be used by the 'nflist' function

It contains
- tables of A5 number fields, from John JONES and David ROBERTS
  (https://hobbes.la.asu.edu/NFDB/). These are needed for groups 5T4 (= A5)
  and 6T4 (= A5(6))
- tables of regular extensions of Q(t) for most transitive subgroups
  of S_n, n <= 15, by Juergen KLUENERS and Gunter MALLE (see G. Malle and B.
  H. Matzat, Inverse Galois Theory, Springer, 1999). These are needed by
  nflist(G, 't) for groups of degree 8 or more

See <http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html> for other PARI/GP packages.
