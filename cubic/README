CUBIC, vestion 1.3.

0) Prerequisite: make sure the PARI/GP library is installed on your system

1) Configuration: the default Makefile, assumes that your PARI/GP library
is recent (e.g. 2.9.0), was compiled with gmp, and is installed in the standard
location. As would be produced by the standard procedure
  ./Configure && make install
Have a look at the numbered configuration options at the top of 'Makefile';
modify if your installation is non-standard.

2) Compilation: simply type

  make 

This will produce two binaries :
  cubic-noprint: only *count* the fields
  cubic        : also *output* the fields (about ten times slower).

3) Usage: both binaries use the same syntax, with a single argument
describing a range of discriminants. Restriction: the discriminants
considered must all have the same signs.

  1000          : discriminants in [0, 1000]
  -1000         : discriminants in [-1000, 0]
  [1000, 2000]  : discriminants in [1000, 2000]
  [-2000, -1000]: discriminants in [-2000, -1000]
  [-2000, 2000] : FORBIDDEN (different signs!)
  [58343207081] : discriminants EXACTLY 58343207081

You may use any arithmetic expression in the GP language provided it is
enclosed within quotes:

  ./cubic-noprint "2*10^10"

Extra Flags:
  -g <debuglevel>: be increasingly verbose [ default: 0 ]
